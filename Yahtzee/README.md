This is where I made a little yahtzee game for the terminal.  
I originally planned to add Joker Rules, but I lost the motivation to do so.  
Some pieces of the save system are there, but it doesn't work.  
Everything else should be functional.  

Controls:  
r to roll, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to save (or not save) that die. You can type multiple dice.  
If the die is yellow, it **is not** being saved. If the die is blue or purple, it **is** being saved.  

Type (or copy and paste) the exact name of the box to fill. This is to prevent unintentional fillings of boxes.  

Press 'q' to quit.
