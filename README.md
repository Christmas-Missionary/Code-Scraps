# What is this?  

This is a collection of little things I made in my free time.  
*I made these because I wanted to.*  
Everything you see is the full code to those projects as well as a couple other files (.gitignore, .editorconfig, etc.) I am comfortable publishing.  
I do not plan on improving the code of these projects, but I do plan on posting other nonserious projects here when I decide to. If I am serious about a project, it gets its own repo.  

Think of this as just "scraps" of code, or just another place to look for someone searching for code.
