This is a terminal version of the tower of Hanoi.  

Controls:  
You will type 2 numbers per turn.  
The first number is the column. The top ring in that column will be moved.  
The second number is where to move it.  
1 = 2 columns left  
2 = 1 column left  
3 = 1 column right  
4 = 2 columns right  

Note to self: Make 2nd number be the direct column for the ring to move to.
